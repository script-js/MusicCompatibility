Privacy Policy
--------------------------------------
I do not collect or use any information from Spotify. This tool does not have any servers or databases to store data. I only include a privacy policy because Spotify requires it for unlimited users. This tool is open-source and the code can be viewed at https://github.com/script-js/MusicCompatibility.
